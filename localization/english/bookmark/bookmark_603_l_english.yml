Still, prince Arthas Menethil intends to fight on and safeguard his people and his future realm.\nElsewhere, in the arctic continent of Northrend, contact has been lost with all human settlements and colonies. The powerful local empires of the Nerubians and Drakkari Trolls once so mighty are retreating from a new rising power, the Lich King.
