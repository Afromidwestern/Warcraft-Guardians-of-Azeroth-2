 bm_the_frozen_throne_desc:0 "The apocalyptic Third War has come to an end and with it the Burning Legion's reign of chaos. The demon-lord Archimonde has been destroyed and the demonic invasion repelled, Azeroth was saved. Now, in the aftermath of the war, the night elves are rebuilding their wounded civilisation in Kalimdor, not far from their new neighbors exiled from the Eastern Kingdoms. Both humans and orcs settled in the continent to found their respective realms of Theramore and Durotar. To the east, Lordaeron is now dominated by the undead and ruled over by its new king, Arthas, in the name of the Lich-King.
 
 The world is not yet in peace, however, for the Lich-King is weakened and the Legion does not wish his treason to stay unpinished. Remaining dreadlords fight to keep control of the Scourge, while the fallen night-elf Illidan Stormrage has been recruited by Kil'Jaeden to destroy the Frozen Throne itself. The fate of the Scourge is set and the Frozen Throne is the prize, a prize that may change the face of Azeroth forever.
 
 Will the Lich-King finally free himself from his demonic masters to pursue his own evil agenda ? What fate awaits his champion, prince Arthas ? What does Illidan Stormrage plans to vainquish this terrible foe ?  "

#Ner'zhul

 nerzhul_character_desc:0 "When the Elder Shaman Ner'Zhul was remade as the Lich-King, he was destined to be the vanguard of the Burning Legion, a tool to destroy all those who would have opposed the demons and to bring them back in this world. However, undeath only enhanced the former shaman's prescience, and he predicted the Legion's defeat. Through the runeblade Frostmourne, Ner'Zhul recruited his champion, prince Arthas, to prepare his liberation from both the Frozen Throne and the Legion. With Archimonde's defeat at mount Hyjal, Ner'Zhul never got closer to his goal than he is right now, but his jailers, the dreadlords, still oversee his army, while other agents of the Legion are sent after him. Weakened by his ennemies's magic, Ner'Zhul's control over his minions might be endangered, and the Lich-King is as close to oblivion as he is to freedom.
 
 Ner'Zhul's plans are coming to their term, will they succeed ? Will the Frozen Throne be destroyed ? Or will it ends in the hold of a new master ? "

 #Luc Valonforth

 valonforth_character_desc:0 "Captain Luc Valonforth of the Alliance's first legion is a loyal officer of Lordaeron. As one of prince Arthas's former lieutenants, Valonforth followed his master in the expedition to Northrend against Mal'Ganis, to better end betrayed by the corrupted prince. Unlike his fellow captains and comrades, though, Luc Valonforth and his men were not slain by Frostmourne but abandonned and left stranded on the frozen shores of Northrend. With no way to return to Lordaeron, the remaining Alliance warriors held their position in Northrend, trying to survive. Now, with the Scourge weakened and the Illidari invasion of Northrend, opportunities may present to Valonforth to push back the undead and secure his position. One day, perhaps, ships will bring the forgotten legion back home...
 
 Are the abandoned soldiers doomed to death in the frozen north or will they be able to survive or even prosper in the cold wasteland ?"
