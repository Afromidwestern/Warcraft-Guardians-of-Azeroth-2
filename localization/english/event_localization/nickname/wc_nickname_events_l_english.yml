 WCNIC.0001.t:0 "The Oldest One"
 WCNIC.0001.desc:0 "As a long time has passed as the ruler of [Root.CHARACTER.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], you notice your subjects and the surrounding population has started to refer to you as “the Old Murkeye” due to your long reign and the many years it has been since you have been a tadpole. The noblest of your subjects give the idea of a ceremony to earn this as an official nickname, they prepare the ceremony and all that is left is for you to step on the rock and give the gurgling speech for the army of Murloc raiders in front of you."
 WCNIC.0001.a:0 "Mrghllghghllghg !"
 WCNIC.0001.b:0 "Mrglrlhglrlg..."
 WCNIC.0001.tt.a:0 "The murloc raiders cheer and gurgle your nickname."
 WCNIC.0001.tt.b:0 "You turn away from the stone and walk away in refusal, eventually the Murloc crowd dissipates. The nickname of "the Old Murkeye" slowly fades away in time."

 WCNIC.0002.t:0 "Ice of Veins"
 WCNIC.0002.desc:0 "To maintain such a populous that of [Root.CHARACTER.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], a ruler must be strong and unforgiving to keep them in check, your reign has been no exception to this standard. Your firm and merciless acts send fear throughout the streets and homes of the people, cruel and arbitrary in your ways. Men, women, and children alike start to truly wonder if your heart is as cold as ice…"
 WCNIC.0002.a:0 "I will embrace this fearful title."
 WCNIC.0002.b:0 "I refuse this title, and I will work for redemption to cleanse myself of my past atrocities."
