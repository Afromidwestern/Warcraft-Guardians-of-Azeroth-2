 wc_religious_interaction.1011:0 "We have your received your letter, [actor.GetTitledFirstName]. The Inquisition is grateful for your willing surrender. Agents are already on their way to take you into custody, and you are expected to cooperate with them to the greatest of your ability.\n\nKnow that this will not spare you from the rigors of true penitance, but that you chose not to flee or fight the Inquisition may win you the trust of some."
 wc_religious_interaction.1011.cynical:0 "Let's get this over with."
 wc_religious_interaction.1011.zealous:0 "Do your worst, inquisitors, faith is my strength."
 wc_religious_interaction.1011.deceitful:0 "I knew it would come to this, I am prepared."
 wc_religious_interaction.1011.normal:0 "I know that I am innocent, as will they."

 wc_religious_interaction.1020:0 "Several of your peers have found your faith and morals lacking. [actor.GetTitledFirstName] has personally attested to your many failings, and I fear that I cannot let them go unpunished."
 wc_religious_interaction.1021:0 "For too long your actions have gone unnoticed, but this ends today. You are suspected of betraying the tenants of [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate]. You must stand trial before the [actor.GetFaith.ReligiousHeadTitleName] or be branded a heretic. May [actor.GetFaith.HighGodName] have mercy on your soul... For we will not."
 wc_religious_interaction.1022:0 "[actor.GetTitledFirstName], your tales of [secondary_recipient.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] heresies concern me. To think that such villainy could occur under my watch is sickening, I have deemed it necessary to place the Scarlet Mark upon [secondary_recipient.GetHerHim|l].\n\nI marked [secondary_recipient.GetTitledFirstName], branding him an enemy to [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate]."
 wc_religious_interaction.1023:0 "The [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate] mission is most righteous, and demands its followers to be equally so. It is every fighter of [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternatePossessive] duty to look upon his comrades and ensure their loyalty and faith, and to call out whoever errs.\n\nHowever, your request to have [secondary_recipient.GetTitledFirstName] with the Scarlet Mark has been denied. Whatever guilt you see in [secondary_recipient.GetHerHim|l], the Inquisition has not found. I would advise you to be more careful with your accusations, lest the conclave begin to suspect you to be hiding secrets yourself."
 wc_religious_interaction.1024:0 "[recipient.GetTitledFirstName], you bear the Scarlet Mark, branding you an irredeemable heretic. Your failings, that which brought about your branding, have not been forgiven, but we believe that they can be redeemed.\n\n The time you spent Marked has clearly changed you for the better. I has deemed it fit for the Scarlet Mark to be removed. From now and forward, you may rejoin the ranks of the Faithful."
