 # Religious Head of Faith Interactions
 wc_religious_interaction.1020:0 "Several of your peers have found your faith and morals lacking. [actor.GetTitledFirstName] has personally attested to your many failings, and I fear that I cannot let them go unpunished."
 wc_religious_interaction.1021:0 "For too long your actions have gone unnoticed, but this ends today. You are suspected of betraying the tenants of [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate]. You must stand trial before the [actor.GetFaith.ReligiousHeadTitleName] or be branded a heretic. May [actor.GetFaith.HighGodName] have mercy on your soul... For we will not."
 wc_religious_interaction.1022:0 "[actor.GetTitledFirstName], your tales of [secondary_recipient.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] heresies concern me. To think that such villainy could occur under my watch is sickening, I have deemed it necessary to place the Scarlet Mark upon [secondary_recipient.GetHerHim|l].\n\nI marked [secondary_recipient.GetTitledFirstName], branding him an enemy to [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate]"
 wc_religious_interaction.1023:0 "The [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate] mission is most righteous, and demands its followers to be equally so. It is every fighter of [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternatePossessive] duty to look upon his comrades and ensure their loyalty and faith, and to call out whoever errs.\n\nHowever, your request to have [secondary_recipient.GetTitledFirstName] with the Scarlet Mark has been denied. Whatever guilt you see in [secondary_recipient.GetHerHim|l], the Inquisition has not found. I would advise you to be more careful with your accusations, lest the conclave begin to suspect you to be hiding secrets yourself."
