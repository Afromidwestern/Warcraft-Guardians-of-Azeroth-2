You see the massive decayed remains of a great kodo. The bones are bleached by the sun and covered with dust, but they still retain some of their majesty and power.\n\nYou wonder how this kodo lived and how it died, what stories it could tell, and what wisdom it could impart. You approach the remains with reverence and respect, hoping to learn something from this encounter."

#Earth Mother's Blessing Event
tauren_event_2_name:"Spirit Walking"

tauren.2.desc:"You wake up in a beautiful tent, adorned with symbols of nature and tribal beauty. You feel a warm breeze caressing your skin, and the faint scent of herbs and flowers. You look around and realize that this is not at all where you slept last night.\n\nWhere are you? How did you get here? You wonder if this is a dream, or something more. You notice how spacious the tent is, and feel the warth of the cozy fireplace. You see paintings of mountain landscapes and serene mesas, carvings of animals, and woven rugs. You feel a sense of calm and tranquility.\n\nYou notice a cup of warm herbal tea on a wooden table next to your bed. You pick it up and take a sip. As the soothing liquid flow down your throat, you taste the flavors of mint, chamomile, and honey, and feel a wave of relaxation wash over you. The birds chirping sound hits you, inviting you to exit the tent and see the world."
tauren.2.a:"Step outside..."
tauren.21.desc:"As you step outside, you are greeted by the sight of a magnificent city built on towering mesas. Wooden bridges and platforms connect the different levels of this ageless city, and colorful banners and flags wave proudly in the wind. You hear the sound of birds chirping, see hawks swooping and hear kodos rumbling. A surge of joy and awe fills your heart, as you admire this place.\n\nYou see great plains stretching as far as the eye can see. Majestic waterfalls catch your eyes, cascading from cliffs and forming pools and rivers below. Towering mountains stretch in the distance, some covered with snow, others green. The sky above, clear and blue, with a few clouds. You feel like you are in a paradise, a dream come true."
tauren.21.a:"Explore the city further..."
tauren.22.desc:"Feeling a strange pull towards the top of the highest mesa, you decide to head there. You walk along the wooden bridges and platforms, admiring the loving craftsmanship that went into the construction of this magnificent city. White smoke rises from the totemic chimneys of the city's tents, and the aroma of fresh bread and meat makes your stomach rumble. Children dart around you playing and laughing, while elders rest calmly sharing grand tales to the calmer younglings. You see warriors clad in engraved leather armor each styled to represent a different animal practice their skills against one another.\n\nYou look around and see how the inhabitants of this city go about their daily lives. Taurens, orcs and others whom their appearance you've never seen its like before wander about, some trading, others praying and some, even fishing. They all greet you warmly, as if they know you - or better yet, expecting you. You feel a sense of belonging, and before you know it, you find yourself just a few steps away from the mesa's peak. A nearby signpost reads out the mesa's name, High Rise."
tauren.22.a:"Just a little bit further..."
tauren.23.desc:"You reach the top of the highest mesa, where you see a rune circle surrounded by five engraved totems. Each totem is carved in its own intricate form. A spirit animal is perched calmly in front of each totem, occasionally looking around as if its looking out for predators. There is a Wolf, an Elk, a Bear, a Kodo, and a Hawk. Only now do you realize the significance of this place, the spirits of the Earth Mother that you have long sheparded has chosen you as their champion. Very few have ever recieved such a noteworthy blessing, and you feel both humble and proud to be one of the chosen.\n\nYou inspect the five spirit animals, each one radiating a different aura and energy. You feel drawn to each one of them, and they to you, but you can only choose one. You wonder which one will best suit you and your goals. You think about your life, your ambitions, your challenges, and your dreams. You think about what kind of person you are, and what kind of person you want to be.\n\nYou make your decision, and walk towards the spirit animal that calls to you the most. You hope that this will be the right choice for you, and that the Earth Mother will always smile upon you."

tauren_event_3_name:"Spirit's Wrath"
tauren.3.desc:"You wake up wet and feeling a freezing cold, barely able to breathe. A sharp pain thumps in your chest, and there's a heavy weight surrounding your limbs. You look around frantically, and see that you are surrounded by trees and shrubbery in all directions. You smell dampness and decay, and hear the sound of animals howling, growling, and screeching. You wonder where you are, and how you got here. You remember that you have angered the spirits of nature, and turned your back on your faith, perhaps they are here to exact their revenge. One way or another.\n\n"You have forsaken the spirits of nature, and they have forsaken you. This is our realm of horror, where the spirits of death dwell. Here you will face your punishment." You hear these words uttered in your mind by a voiceless figure and a shapeless spirit."
tauren.3.a:"Attempt to stand back up..."
tauren.31.desc:"You look at the five spirit animals, each one radiating a different aura and energy. You feel repelled by each one of them, but you know deep down you must decide to suffer the punishment of one of them. You wonder which one will be the least painful or the most merciful for you. You think about your life, your sins, your regrets, and your fears. “If you remember what each of us represented, you’ll know the suffering that each of us will inflict. A final test for this fallen champion…“ The voiceless spirit says.\n\nYou force yourself back to your feet. You ponder for a moment, but eventually make your decision, and walk towards the spirit animal that seems to be the best option for you.

You open your eyes and see that you are lying on a soft bed of grass, and you can breathe easily. You try to move, and you feel that the weight that been holding you down for a while now has dissipated.\n\nYou look around and see that you are surrounded by trees and flowers. You see the sun shining through the branches, and hear the sound of birds singing, and animals playing. You wonder where you are, and how you got here. You remember that you sought repentance, and turned back to the Earth Mother's path."
tauren.4.a:"Attempt to stand back up..."
tauren.41.desc:"You get up and walk around, curious to see more of this place. As you do, you see five familiar faces emerging from the shadows. They are the spirit animals that once blessed you, then cursed you, and now have forgiven you. They look at you with a mix of emotions, some happy, some sad, some proud, some disappointed. They speak to you in a gentle and warm voice.\n\n"You have returned to the Earth Mother's path, and we have allowed it. You have shown remorse and sincerity, and we have appreciated it. You have endured your punishment, and we have lifted it. You are one of our pack, once again."\n\n"You have come to a place of grace and hope, where the spirits of life and death dwell. Here you can start anew, and rebuild your relationship with the Earth Mother. We are your friends and your mentors, and will guide you whenever you desire. But to be granted our gift once again will require a great deal of perseverance, young one. Forgiveness is a long road, one that you are halfway through...""

#Ambushed Kodo Caravan Megaevent
tauren_event_5_name:"A Trail of Smoke and Ash"
tauren.5.desc:"As you are travelling through the wilds of [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetNameNoTooltip], a large cloud of blackend dust and smoke catch your eye. It looks like a fire has broken out somewhere, and you wonder if it is a natural disaster or a sign of trouble. Your companion, [SCOPE.sC('companion').GetName], who is riding beside you, also sees the smoke and asks whether we should investigate or be on our way. You are about to answer when you hear a loud rumble followed by a flash of light from the direction of the smoke. You see a column of flame shoot up into the sky.\n\n[SCOPE.sC('companion').GetName] looks at you, clearly disturbed by what has just transpired, but nevertheless remain prepared to follow whichever command you give."
tauren.5.a:"Investigate the smoke..."
tauren.5.b:"We have no time for this, stay on our path..."
tauren.51.desc:"You arrive at the source of the heavy smoke and soon discover the source of the disturbance; a trade caravan has been ambushed and raided by a band of marauders. The wagons are overturned and burning, the goods are looted or destroyed, and the bodies of the traders and their guards are scattered across the road. You see no sign of the attackers, but you hear a faint groan coming from the other side of the wreckage.\n\nYou get off your mount and approach the scene cautiously, looking for any clues or survivors. You notice that the caravan was well-equipped and guarded, with sturdy wagons and armed escorts. The traders were wearing fine clothes, indicating that they were wealthy and influential. You deduce that the caravan was travelling from the south, probably from one of the major cities or ports. They were heading to the north, perhaps to where you were headed as well.\n\nYou hear the groan again, louder this time, and you follow it to its source."
tauren.51.a:"Investigate the groaning sound..."
tauren.52.desc:"You find a kodo lying on its side, bleeding from several wounds. It is the head kodo of the caravan, a massive and majestic creature that carries the banner of its owner. You recognize the banner belonging to [SCOPE.sC('kodo_owner').GetName], a prominent ruler who is well-known and does a considerable amount of trade in these lands. You wonder what they would think if they saw their prized animal in this state.\n\nThe kodo looks at you with weary eyes, as if pleading for mercy. You feel a surge of pity for the beast, but also a sense of opportunity. Perhaps there is something valuable hidden in its saddlebags, or maybe you could can sell its hide and horns for crafting. Or maybe you should just end its suffering and honor its spirit."
tauren.52.a:"Loot the kodo's saddlebags and leave it to die..."
tauren.52.b:"Put the great kodo out of its misery..."
tauren.52.c:"Summon the healers! Quickly before it perishes!"

tauren.52.g:"Write a letter to the caravan's owner..."
tauren.52.f_winSkillCheck:"You successfully find the raiders camp."
tauren.52.f_loseSkillCheck:"You fail to track the raiders band."
tauren.521.desc:"Your healers approach the kodo cautiously, and it seems to sense their good intentions, or it's too weak to reject them. You inspect the kodo's injuries, tens of arrows dot its hard scales, while a large bleeding gash stretches across its stomach, occasionally spewing out more blood. You know that you'll healers will need to act quickly to save the kodo's life.\n\nThe healers quickly work to stop the bleeding and prevent infection. The gash on the kodo's stomach is the deepest wound. The healers carefully begin stitching the wound together, using a needle and thread made from animal sinew. They then apply a bandage to the wound to stop the bleeding. Not long after, they hand over the kodo some water to drink and some food to eat.\n\nIt doesn't take long before the exhausted kodo falls asleep. It will survive, [SCOPE.sC('companion').GetName] assures you."

It's over, the saddened look from [SCOPE.sC('companion').GetName] assures you of that reality."

tauren.522.b:"We have wasted enough time here, let's move..."
tauren.53.desc:"You follow the trail of the raiders, hoping to find their camp and confront them. You ride for a while, until you see a faint glow and hear some noises in the distance. You approach cautiously, and soon enough, a large bonfire and a few tents snap into view. In the center of it all, their leader - [SCOPE.sC('shoeless_bandit').GetName] rests.\n\nYou observe the camp from a safe distance, looking for any signs of movement or danger. You notice that the raiders are not that many, probably less than a dozen. You guess that they must have suffered some losses during their attack on the caravan, or perhaps they have split up into smaller groups. They do not seem to be alert or vigilant, instead focusing on their celebration.\n\nYou see some of the goods that they have stolen from the caravan, as well as some weapons and armor that belong to the traders and their guards.\n\nYour companion, [SCOPE.sC('companion').GetName] walks up to you and tells you that he has found something useful in the caravan's wagons, a powerful scroll. It seems to contains a spell that might consume everything in its path. You think that it might be your best chance to deal with the raiders quickly and efficiently, without risking your life or alerting anyone else - if you have the aptitude to use it..."
tauren.53.a:"Slay them all!"
tauren.53.b:"Approach them queitly, strike at the heart..."

tauren.53.b_loseSkillCheck:"You are spotted by the leader and his fellow raiders as you approach."
tauren.53.c:"Demand their surrender..."
tauren.53.d:"It's time to see what this scroll can do..."
tauren.54.desc:"You mount your horse and follow the trail of blood and hoofprints that they left behind. You hope that they are not too far away, and that you can catch them before they reach their hideout.\n\nYou ride for a while, keeping your eyes on the ground and your ears alert for any sounds of danger. You notice that the trail is getting fainter and more erratic, as if the raiders were trying to cover their tracks or confuse their pursuers. You try to use your intuition and experience to guess their movements and direction, but you are not very confident in your skills.\n\nYou reach a point where the trail disappears completely, and you have no idea where to go next. You look around, but you see nothing but barren land and scattered rocks. You have lost them. You curse yourself for your failure to find the raiders. You turn your horse around, and head back to where you started. "
tauren.54.a:"Write a letter to the nearest holding. We failed..."
tauren.55_winSkillCheck:"You successfully defeat [SCOPE.sC('shoeless_bandit').GetName] and his band."

tauren.551.desc:"You draw your weapon and charge at the leader, hoping to kill him before he can rally his men. You clash with [SCOPE.sC('shoeless_bandit').GetName] in a fierce duel, exchanging blows and parries. The leader is a formidable opponent, and he fights with skill and strength. He swings his axe at you, trying to cleave you in half. You dodge or block his attacks, looking for an opening to strike him down.\n\nMeanwhile, your soldiers join the fray, fighting with the raiders who are trying to stop them.

You see the flames rise high into the sky, lighting up the night. You hear the explosions and crackles, as the wagons and tents are blown apart. You smell the smoke and ash, as the goods and bodies are reduced to dust. You feel the heat and shockwave, as the fire reaches you and pushes you back.\n\nYou see nothing but blood and flames, as the raiders are killed and dismembered by your scroll. You see their limbs and organs flying in the air, landing on the ground or burning in the fire. You see their faces contorted in pain and fear, melting or charred beyond recognition. You see their eyes staring at you, accusing or pleading for mercy.\n\nYou mount your horse and ride away from the camp. You realize that you have lost most of the loot that you could have taken from the raiders. You wonder if it was worth it, or if you could have done something else."

cen_kal.1.desc:"You are sitting in the council chamber, discussing the affairs of your realm with your advisors, when you hear a knock on the door. You tell the person to enter, and you see your acting marshal, [SCOPE.sC('companion').GetName], walking in. They look excited and eager, and they have a map in their hand. They bow to you and say:\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], I have good news. We have found the location of the raider encampment that has been plaguing our neighbor, [SCOPE.sC('kodo_owner').GetName], caravans. They are hiding in a valley near the border, where they have set up a camp and a watchtower. They are not expecting any attack, and they are vulnerable to a surprise assault."\n\nThey show you the map, pointing out the details of the terrain and the enemy position. They say: "I propose that we take advantage of this opportunity and strike them hard and fast. We can lead a small contingent force of our best soldiers, mounted, and ambush them at dawn. We can catch them off guard, destroy their camp, capture their loot, and finish off their leader, [SCOPE.sC('shoeless_bandit').GetName]. This will end their threat once and for all, and will surely earn us the gratitude and respect of our neighbor."\n\nThey look at you with enthusiasm and anticipation, waiting for your response.

cen_kal.1001.desc:"You are about to leave the council chamber after a long and exhausting day of managing your holdings, when one of your guards’ rushes in and bows before you. He tells you that there is a band of prospectors waiting outside, who claim that they have an urgent matter to discuss with you. You order the guard to let them in, and see a group of goblins standing outside. They are wearing colorful clothes and hats, and have a wide grin on their faces.\n\nTheir leader steps forward: “Hello, hello, your majesty!” one of them says in a high-pitched voice. “We are here to offer you a deal of a lifetime! A chance to make a fortune beyond your wildest dreams!” You raise an eyebrow and ask them to explain themselves. [SCOPE.sC('goblin_prospector').GetName] coughs and steps forward pulling out a map. They point to the [depot_location.GetName] in your territory and says:\n\n“See this spot right here? It’s rich in oil, a precious liquid that can be used to power machines, weapons, and vehicles. We have the technology and the expertise to extract it from the ground and refine it into useful products. All we need is your permission and some initial funding. And in return, we're ready to give you fifty per-" Another goblin interrupts the leader, shouts in their ear before the leader calms down, grins, then continues: "Thirty percent of the income from the oil sales. How does that sound?”"
cen_kal.1001.a:"You goblins have yourself a deal!"

cen_kal.1002.desc:"One of your guards’ rushes in and bows before you, telling you that your goblin "partners" are outside and would like a word. They wobble into your throne room, carrying a large chest full of gold. The leader, [SCOPE.sC('goblin_prospector').GetName], greets you with a loud and cheerful voice: "Hey, hey, hey, your majesty! We have some great news for you! Our oil project is a smashing success! We have been pumping and selling oil like crazy! We have made a ton of money, and we thought we'd drop in and give you your cut!"\n\nThe gaurds open the chest and you see stacks of gold coins, jewels, and other valuable items. You also glance at some papers and graphs they brought, and it does in fact confirm what the goblins have said. The oil project in [depot_location.GetName] has indeed been a profitable enterprise for both parties. You are amazed by the goblins' talent and efficiency, as well as their loyalty more than anything.\n\n[SCOPE.sC('goblin_prospector').GetName] sees that you have finished looking at their report, and says: "Whenever you wanna give us more money, we can make it bigger, and...better. Win-win eh!""

Instead, you only received vague and evasive reports from them, claiming that they were still working on the project, and that they needed more time and money. You trusted them and gave them more funds, hoping that they would eventually deliver on their deal.\n\nNow, you have discovered that the goblins, and their leader - [ROOT.Var('goblin_prospector').Char.GetTitledFirstName] have vanished with all of your money, leaving behind a worthless and abandoned oil mine in [ROOT.Var('depot_location').Province.GetBaronyNameExplicitly]. You have been duped by their lies and tricks, and have lost a fortune in the process. You have also damaged your reputation and credibility among your subjects, vassals, and allies, who think that you are a fool for trusting the goblins."

The goblins managed to extract and refine large quantities of oil from the ground, and sold it to various buyers and markets.\n\nBut alas, you have just received some devastating news. Your acting steward, [SCOPE.sC('steward').GetName] has just notified you that a patrol has found the oil depot in charred ruins. Apparently, an unexpected explosion has killed the majority of the goblins and their leader - [ROOT.Var('goblin_prospector').Char.GetTitledFirstName] at the site, and has caused massive damage to the surrounding area in [ROOT.Var('depot_location').Province.GetBaronyNameExplicitly].

They say that they have overthrown the former leader - [SCOPE.sC('old_prospector').GetFirstName], who was corrupt and incompetent, and have taken charge of the project. They also claim to be far more trustworthy and efficient than their predecessor, and that they would like to restart the original deal with you. They say that they will retain the agreed share of the income from the oil sales from the old deal but are in need of further investment to repair the damages caused to the depot during the coup.\n\nYou are not sure what to make of this letter. You wonder if this new goblin leader is better or worse than the old one. You wonder how your subjects, vassals, and allies will react to this proposal."
