#Kodo Remains Event
tauren_event_1_name:0 "Even Giants Fall"

tauren.1.desc:0 "One day, as you were traveling across [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetNameNoTooltip], you come across a sight that fills you with awe. You see the massive decayed remains of a great kodo. The bones are bleached by the sun and covered with dust, but they still retain some of their majesty and power.\n\nYou wonder how this kodo lived and how it died, what stories it could tell, and what wisdom it could impart. You approach the remains with reverence and respect, hoping to learn something from this encounter."
tauren.1.a:0 "Inspect the remains further..."
tauren.12.desc:0 "You see that the kodo's ribs are marked with scars and scratches, suggesting that it had endured many battles and injuries in its life. You can infer that it was a brave and resilient beast, who never gave up or surrendered, which faced every challenge with courage and determination. You feel a pang of sympathy and respect for this valiant creature, who shared your spirit of adventure and defiance.\n\nAs you look closer you see that the kodo's bones are surrounded by dried plants and flowers, indicating that it had died peacefully and naturally in its old age. You can sense that it had lived a long and fulfilling life, that it had seen many wonders and experienced many joys, and that it had left behind a rich legacy and a grateful herd. You feel a calm of serenity and gratitude for this wise creature, who shared your vision of harmony and balance."
tauren.12.a:0 "Inspect the kodo's skull..."

tauren.13.desc:0 "You notice that the kodo's skull bears a large horn that curves upwards, indicating that it was a male and a leader of its herd. You can imagine how it fought off predators and rivals, how it protected its mates and offspring, and how it guided its kin through harsh seasons and perilous journeys. You feel a surge of admiration and kinship for this noble creature, which shared your values of honor and strength.\n\nYou stand before the kodo's remains for a long time, contemplating its life and death, its lessons and gifts. You wonder what kind of end you should wish for yourself, what kind of legacy you want to leave behind, and what kind of wisdom you want to pass on."
tauren.14.desc:0 "You notice that the kodo’s ribs are marked with notches and symbols, suggesting that it had given birth to many offspring and taught them many secrets in its life. This is the remains of a great mother. You can infer that it was a loving and nurturing beast, who cared for its family and tribe, who shared its knowledge and wisdom with its kin. You feel a warmth of affection and admiration for this gentle creature, which shared your sense of loyalty and tradition.\n\nYou stand before the kodo's remains for a long time, contemplating its life and death, its lessons and gifts. You wonder what kind of end you should wish for yourself, what kind of legacy you want to leave behind, and what kind of wisdom you want to pass on."

tauren.13.a:0 "We will all find our way back to the Earth Mother one day..."
tauren.13.b:0 "To have lived such a great life, only to be forgotten..."
tauren.13.c:0 "What a wasted life..."
tauren.13.d:0 "Honor the kodo with a prayer to the Earth Mother"
tauren.13.e:0 "That horn would fetch quite a price..."

#Earth Mother's Blessing Event
tauren_event_2_name:0 "Spirit Walking"

tauren.2.desc:0 "You wake up in a beautiful tent, adorned with symbols of nature and tribal beauty. You feel a warm breeze caressing your skin, and the faint scent of herbs and flowers. You look around and realize that this is not at all where you slept last night.\n\nWhere are you? How did you get here? You wonder if this is a dream, or something more. You notice how spacious the tent is, and feel the warmth of the cozy fireplace. You see paintings of mountainous landscapes and serene mesas, carvings of animals, and woven rugs. You feel a sense of calm and tranquility.\n\nYou notice a cup of warm herbal tea on a wooden table next to your bed. You pick it up and take a sip. As the soothing liquid flows down your throat, you taste the flavors of mint, chamomile, and honey, and feel a wave of relaxation wash over you. The birds' chirping sounds hit you, inviting you to exit the tent and see the world."
tauren.2.a:0 "Step outside..."
tauren.21.desc:0 "As you step outside, you are greeted by the sight of a magnificent city built on towering mesas. Wooden bridges and platforms connect the different levels of this ageless city, and colorful banners and flags fly proudly in the wind. You hear the sound of birds chirping, see hawks swooping, and hear kodos rumbling. A surge of joy and awe fills your heart, as you admire this place.\n\nYou see great plains stretching as far as the eye can see. Majestic waterfalls catch your eyes, cascading from cliffs and forming pools and rivers below. Towering mountains stretch in the distance, some covered with snow, others green. The sky above, is clear and blue, with a few clouds. You feel like you are in a paradise, a dream come true."
tauren.21.a:0 "Explore the city further..."
tauren.22.desc:0 "Feeling a strange pull towards the top of the highest mesa, you decide to head there. You walk along the wooden bridges and platforms, admiring the loving craftsmanship that went into the construction of this magnificent city. White smoke rises from the totemic chimneys of the city's tents, and the aroma of fresh bread and meat makes your stomach rumble. Children dart around you playing and laughing, while elders rest calmly sharing grand tales to the calmer younglings. You see warriors clad in engraved leather armor each styled to represent a different animal practice their skills against one another.\n\nYou look around and see how the inhabitants of this city go about their daily lives. Taurens, orcs and others whom their appearance you've never seen its like before wander about, some trading, others praying and some, even fishing. They all greet you warmly, as if they know you - or better yet, expecting you. You feel a sense of belonging, and before you know it, you find yourself just a few steps away from the mesa's peak. A nearby signpost reads out the mesa's name, High Rise."
tauren.22.a:0 "Just a little bit further..."
tauren.23.desc:0 "You reach the top of the highest mesa, where you see a rune circle surrounded by five engraved totems. Each totem is carved in its own intricate form. A spirit animal is perched calmly in front of each totem, occasionally looking around as if its looking out for predators. There is a Wolf, an Elk, a Bear, a Kodo, and a Hawk. Only now do you realize the significance of this place, the spirits of the Earth Mother, that you have long sheparded, have chosen you as their champion. Very few have ever received such a noteworthy blessing, and you feel both humbled and proud to be one of the chosen.\n\nYou inspect the five spirit animals, each one radiating a different aura and energy. You feel drawn to each one of them, and they to you, but you can only choose one. You wonder which one will best suit you and your goals. You think about your life, your ambitions, your challenges, and your dreams. You think about what kind of person you are, and what kind of person you want to be.\n\nYou make your decision, and walk towards the spirit animal that calls to you the most. You hope that this will be the right choice for you and that the Earth Mother will always smile upon you."

#Earth Mother's Punishment Event
tauren_event_3_name:0 "Spirit's Wrath"
tauren.3.desc:0 "You wake up wet and feeling a freezing cold, barely able to breathe. A sharp pain thumps in your chest, and there's a heavy weight surrounding your limbs. You look around frantically, and see that you are surrounded by trees and shrubbery in all directions. You smell dampness and decay, and hear the sound of animals howling, growling, and screeching. You wonder where you are, and how you got here. You remember that you have angered the spirits of nature, and turned your back on your faith, perhaps they are here to exact their revenge. One way or another.\n\n"You have forsaken the spirits of nature, and in return they have forsaken you. This is our realm of horror, where the spirits of death dwell. Here you will face your punishment." You hear these words uttered in your mind by a voiceless figure and a shapeless spirit."
tauren.3.a:0 "Attempt to stand back up..."
tauren.31.desc:0 "You look at the five spirit animals, each one radiating a different aura and energy. You feel repelled by each one of them, but you know deep down you must decide to suffer the punishment of one of them. You wonder which one will be the least painful or the most merciful for you. You think about your life, your sins, your regrets, and your fears. “If you remember what each of us represented, you’ll know the suffering that each of us will inflict. A final test for this fallen champion…“ The voiceless spirit says.\n\nYou force yourself back to your feet. You ponder for a moment, but eventually make your decision, and walk towards the spirit animal that seems to be the best option for you. You hope that this will be the end of your suffering, or at least a chance for redemption."

#Earth Mother's Forgiveness Event
tauren_event_4_name:0 "Spirit Healing"
tauren.4.desc:0 "You wake up warm and dry in a verdant and yellow forest. You feel a light breeze caressing your skin, and a sweet scent of flowers and fruits. You open your eyes and see that you are lying on a soft bed of grass, and you can breathe easily. You try to move, and you feel that the weight that has been holding you down for a while has dissipated.\n\nYou look around and see that you are surrounded by trees and flowers. You see the sun shining through the branches and hear the sound of birds singing and animals playing. You wonder where you are, and how you got here. You remember that you sought repentance, and turned back to the Earth Mother's path."
tauren.4.a:0 "Attempt to stand back up..."
tauren.41.desc:0 "You get up and walk around, curious to see more of this place. As you do, you see five familiar faces emerging from the shadows. They are the spirit animals that once blessed you, then cursed you, and now have forgiven you. They look at you with a mix of emotions, some happy, some sad, some proud, some disappointed. They speak to you in a gentle and warm voice.\n\n"You have returned to the Earth Mother's path, and we have allowed it. You have shown remorse and sincerity, and we have appreciated it. You have endured your punishment, and we have lifted it. You are one of our pack, once again."\n\n"You have come to a place of grace and hope, where the spirits of life and death dwell. Here you can start anew, and rebuild your relationship with the Earth Mother. We are your friends and your mentors, and will guide you whenever you desire. But to be granted our gift once again will require a great deal of perseverance, young one. Forgiveness is a long road, one that you are halfway through...""
tauren.41.a:0 "Earth Mother watch over you..."

#Ambushed Kodo Caravan Megaevent
tauren_event_5_name:0 "A Trail of Smoke and Ash"
tauren.5.desc:0 "As you are traveling through the wilds of [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetNameNoTooltip], a large cloud of blackened dust and smoke catches your eye. It looks like a fire has broken out somewhere and you wonder if it is a natural disaster or a sign of trouble. Your companion, [SCOPE.sC('companion').GetName], who is walking beside you, also sees the smoke and asks whether you should investigate or be on your way. You are about to answer when you hear a loud rumble followed by a flash of light from the direction of the smoke. You see a column of flame shoot up into the sky.\n\n[SCOPE.sC('companion').GetName] looks at you, clearly disturbed by what has just transpired, but nevertheless remains prepared to follow whichever command you give."
tauren.5.a:0 "Investigate the smoke..."
tauren.5.b:0 "We have no time for this, stay on our path..."
tauren.51.desc:0 "You arrive at the source of the heavy smoke and soon discover the source of the disturbance - a trade caravan has been ambushed and raided by a band of marauders. The wagons are overturned and burning, the goods are looted or destroyed, and the bodies of the traders and their guards are scattered across the road. You see no sign of the attackers, but you hear a faint groan coming from the other side of the wreckage.\n\nYou get off your mount and approach the scene cautiously, looking for any clues or survivors. You notice that the caravan was well-equipped and guarded, with sturdy wagons and armed escorts. The traders were wearing fine clothes, indicating that they were wealthy and influential. You deduce that the caravan was traveling from the south, probably from one of the major cities or ports. They were heading to the north, perhaps to where you were headed as well.\n\nYou hear the groan again, louder this time, and you follow it to its source."
tauren.51.a:0 "Investigate the groaning sound..."
tauren.52.desc:0 "You find a kodo lying on its side, bleeding from several wounds. It is the head kodo of the caravan, a massive and majestic creature that carries the banner of its owner. You recognize the banner belonging to [SCOPE.sC('kodo_owner').GetName], a prominent ruler who is well-known and does a considerable amount of trade in these lands. You wonder what they would think if they saw their prized animal in this state.\n\nThe kodo looks at you with weary eyes, as if pleading for mercy. You feel a surge of pity for the beast, but also a sense of opportunity. Perhaps there is something valuable hidden in its saddlebags, or maybe you could sell its hide and horns for crafting. Or maybe you should just end its suffering and honor its spirit."
tauren.52.a:0 "Loot the kodo's saddlebags and leave it to die..."
tauren.52.b:0 "Put the great kodo out of its misery..."
tauren.52.c:0 "Summon the healers! Quickly before it perishes!"
tauren.52.d:0 "Sit with the great kodo till it passes through the vale..."
tauren.52.e:0 "Torture the kodo for fun..."

tauren.52.g:0 "Write a letter to the caravan's owner..."
tauren.52.f_winSkillCheck:0 "You successfully find the raiders' camp."
tauren.52.f_loseSkillCheck:0 "You fail to track the raiders' band."
tauren.521.desc:0 "Your healers approach the kodo cautiously, and it seems to sense their good intentions, or it's too weak to reject them. You inspect the kodo's injuries, tens of arrows dot its hard scales, while a large bleeding gash stretches across its stomach, occasionally spewing out more blood. You know that your healers will need to act quickly to save the kodo's life.\n\nThe healers work quick like the wind to stop the bleeding and prevent any further infection. The gash on the kodo's stomach is the deepest wound. The healers carefully begin stitching the wound together, using a needle and thread made from animal sinew. They then apply a bandage to the wound to stop the bleeding. Not long after, they hand over the kodo some water to drink and some food to eat.\n\nIt doesn't take long before the exhausted kodo falls asleep. It will survive, [SCOPE.sC('companion').GetName] assures you."

tauren.521.d:0 "This is not ours, return it to its owner..."
tauren.522.b:0 "We have wasted enough time here, let's move..."
tauren.53.desc:0 "You follow the trail of the raiders, hoping to find their camp and confront them. You ride for a while, until you see a faint glow and hear some noises in the distance. You approach cautiously, and soon enough, a large bonfire and a few tents snap into view. In the center of it all, their leader - [SCOPE.sC('shoeless_bandit').GetName] rests.\n\nYou observe the camp from a safe distance, looking for any signs of movement or danger. You notice that the raiders are not that many, probably less than a dozen. You guess that they must have suffered some losses during their attack on the caravan, or perhaps they have split up into smaller groups. They do not seem to be alert or vigilant, instead focusing on their celebration.\n\nYou see some of the goods that they have stolen from the caravan, as well as some weapons and armor that belong to the traders and their guards.\n\nYour companion, [SCOPE.sC('companion').GetName], walks up to you and tells you that he has found something useful in the caravan's wagons, a powerful scroll. It seems to contain a spell that could consume everything in its path. You think that it might be your best chance to deal with the raiders quickly and efficiently, without risking your life or alerting anyone else - if you have the aptitude to use it..."
tauren.53.a:0 "Slay them all!"
tauren.53.b:0 "Approach them quietly, strike at the heart..."
tauren.53.b_winSkillCheck:0 "You manage to sneak up on [SCOPE.sC('shoeless_bandit').GetName] and kill him with a swift strike."
tauren.53.b_loseSkillCheck:0 "You are spotted by the leader and his fellow raiders as you approach."
tauren.53.c:0 "Demand their surrender..."
tauren.53.d:0 "It's time to see what this scroll can do..."
tauren.54.desc:0 "You mount up and follow the trail of blood and hoofprints that they left behind. You hope that they are not too far away and that you can catch them before they reach their hideout.\n\nYou ride for a while, keeping your eyes on the ground and your ears alert for any sounds of danger. You notice that the trail is getting fainter and more erratic as if the raiders were trying to cover their tracks or confuse their pursuers. You try to use your intuition and experience to guess their movements and direction, but you are not very confident in your skills.\n\nYou reach a point where the trail disappears completely, and you have no idea where to go next. You look around, but you see nothing but barren land and scattered rocks. You have lost them. You curse yourself for your failure to find the raiders. You turn your horse around and head back to where you started. "
tauren.54.a:0 "Write a letter to the nearest holding. We failed..."

tauren.551.desc:0 "You draw your weapon and charge at the leader, hoping to kill him before he can rally his men. You clash with [SCOPE.sC('shoeless_bandit').GetName] in a fierce duel, exchanging blows and parries. The leader is a formidable opponent, and he fights with skill and strength. He swings his axe at you, trying to cleave you in half. You dodge or block his attacks, looking for an opening to strike him down.\n\nMeanwhile, your soldiers join the fray, fighting with the raiders who are trying to stop them.

cen_kal.1065.desc:0 "It has been ages since the centaur last ruled Kalimdor, the tauren and the quilboar have encroached on our lands and challenged our might. They are weak and cowardly, they have no courage, no glory. They only know how to cheat and scheme. They are always plotting against us, always trying to take what is ours by right.\n\nAfter today, no more. I have crushed the old khanates, reclaimed our old domain, and made the centaur supreme!"
cen_kal.1065.a:0 "I shall go on to honor Theradras!"
cen_kal.1065.b:0 "This is only the begining..."

Against all expectations, [founder.GetFullName] has succeeded in reclaiming a large realm, spanning from Desolace in the West to the Barrens in the East. Though not exact, this has roughly recreated the ancient domain of Maraudor, a fact that the messengers of [founder.GetFullName] are eager to proclaim.\n\nThe hoof-standard of the centaur empire rises once again, but for how long?"
