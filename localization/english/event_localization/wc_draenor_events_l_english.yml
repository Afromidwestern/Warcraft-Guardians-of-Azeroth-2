 WCDRA_5_TITLE:0 "The Dark Portal"
 
 WCDRA_3_DESC:0 "Your army has reached the Dark Portal. After the long siege, your troops occupied the entire area around waiting for your orders.\n\nThe Dark Portal is still active. Enemies can pass it anytime so you have to make a decision quickly: end with this cursed gateway once and for all or leave it be for your own reasons."

 WCDRA_3_OPT_B:0 "Two worlds will stay connected."
 
 WCDRA_5_DESC:0 "All the world trembles in the wake of this momentous day: the Dark Portal has been destroyed.\n\nBy bringing the best and the brightest of [portal_destroyer.GetFullNamePossessive] spellcasters to bear, the great stone gateway that served as a bridge between Azeroth and Draenor was torn asunder and obliterated to nothing more than a pile of rubble and an ominous rift; a tear in the fabric of space and time itself. As the dark energies of the portal exploded outward, the Black Morass - already corrupted by the Portal’s influence - has been scorched into an arid waste of dead earth that many are now beginning to call the Blasted Lands. No one is sure whether this damage is irreversible or if the land might someday be healed, and many magical masters are concerned by what further damage the rift might cause.\n\nAn even greater mystery, however, is what fate yet has in store for the people of Draenor who were caught on either side of the portal during its destruction. Those on Azeroth must now carve their own path in life and find a place in this world as best as they can, while those left behind on Draenor will be doomed to die a slow and painful death alongside their world if nobody stabilizes the rift and reopens the portal…\n\n[portal_destroyer.GetFullNameNicknamed] will do what they can to ensure that doesn’t happen, of course, but what can be done if there yet remains someone with the power and will to open it from the other side?"
 WCDRA_5_OPT_A:0 "We used to call it home..."
 WCDRA_5_OPT_B:0 "What a loss."
 WCDRA_5_OPT_C:0 "And may it never open again."
