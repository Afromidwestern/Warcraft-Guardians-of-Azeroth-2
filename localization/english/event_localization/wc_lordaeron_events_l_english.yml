# 1001 - 1099: Reclamation of Lordaeron Events
##############################################

 lordaeron.1001.title:0 "The Undercity Rebuilt"
 lordaeron.1001.desc:0 "The elevator lurches, and for a moment I am startled, but as the descent begins I quickly regain my composure. My engineers assure me these devices work to a high tolerance, but the effect is no less jarring as machines of this size are uncommon in the scourged wasteland that was once Lordaeron.\n\nAs the elevator descends, a dazzling sight begins to open up to me- a vast city beneath a city, bustling with soldiers, traders, magic users, and of course my growing cadre of government officials. The sewer's vaulted tunnels have been fortified with iron gates and stone reinforcements. Abominations and Forsaken warriors with their menacing crossbows stand guard. [GetGlobalVariable('sylvanas_character').Char.Custom2('GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveOrMy', ROOT.Char)] dream has been realized... From this underground fortress the Forsaken shall never be dislodged!\n\nAs the descent nears its end, I prepare a few words to the gathered throng of Forsaken and allies. Rumors gathered by my [spymaster] and [court_chaplains] tell of hidden knowledge unearthed in the ruins, which has so far escaped our oversight. Our top agents are tracking down this literature at this moment to gague its usefulness to the realm. For now, I must push these thoughts from my mind as I prepare to inagurate this great edifice of our burgeoning culture.\n\nThe elevator slows to a stop..."
 lordaeron.1001.opt.a:0 "This is a momentous day for the Forsaken!"
 lordaeron.1001.tooltip.a:0 "#X We will find out in time if there is any truth to the rumors of hidden knowledge rediscovered in the sewers...#!"

 lordaeron.1002.title:0 "A Dream Deferred"
 lordaeron.1002.desc:0 "Our efforts to secure the Undercity have come to an end, as we have lost our control over the capital city. Perhaps in a number of years we may be able to try again once we have reconquered this territory which is ours by right, but for now it seems the dream of a home beneath the ruins of Lordaeron is outside our reach."
 lordaeron.1002.opt.a:0 "This loss will not go unavenged!"
 lordaeron.1002.tooltip.a:0 "You or another of your culture will be able to build the Undercity again in 5 years."

#1100 - 1109: Selenite Revival

 lordaeron.1101.title:0 "$forgotten_shadow$: The Selinite Revival"
 lordaeron.1101.desc:0 "And so, the other shoe has dropped. During our construction of the Undercity, rumors abounded of hidden knowledge discovered deep within the sewer system. Our inquisitors, agents, and [court_chaplains] have uncovered cells of hidden crypto-religionists following the so-called $forgotten_shadow$. These teachings originated with Natalie Seline, a priest of Stormwind during the Orcish Invasion who heretically invoked her acolytes to embrace and understand the Shadow as well as the Light. Thusly labeled Selinites, these priests were an effective if unorthodox tool in the ultimately futile fight against the Horde.\n\n Now, with her writings given new context in the wake of the Scorge invasion and occupation of Lordaeron, our people who have embraced this nascent religion have taken to calling themselves $forgotten_shadow_adherent_plural$. Now, my councillors implore me to find a way to proceed regarding this new development..."
 lordaeron.1101.opt.a:0 "We will adapt this forbidden knowledge to our advantage!"
 lordaeron.1101.opt.b:0 "Let us have a separation of church and state. Embrace the shadow!"
 lordaeron.1101.opt.c:0 "Our land can be a home for many faiths. Die and let live..."

lordaeron.9001.desc.echoseeker:0 "Our archivists caught a suspicious individual leaving our library sanctum with classified magical grimoires and rare scrolls. Apparently the individual is one of a small sect of liberated undead who seek to regain the "$echo_of_life$" through Arcane magic. Known as "$echo_of_life_adherent_plural$"", these individuals are not known to proselytize actively but often engage in risky and dangerous magical practices. However, as this individual stands before me I can see no hint of malice; rather a pitiful and desperate individual begging for mercy and a second chance.\n\nOn one hand, I can deal justice to this individual as I see fit since they are a convicted thief. On the other, they might make a useful courtier or a potent spy if I can tolerate their pitiful beliefs."
lordaeron.9001.desc.alchemist:0 "Our apothecaries caught a suspicious individual leaving our experimentation chambers with classified alchemical reagents and recipes. Apparently the individual is one of a small sect of liberated undead who reject all divinity known as "$alchemical_materialism_adherent_plural$". These individuals are not known to proselytize actively but often engage in risky and dangerous alchemical practices. As this individual stands before me I can not ignore a hint of malice behind the glimmering intellect of a crafty and talented alchemist.\n\nOn one hand, I can deal justice to this individual as I see fit since they are a convicted thief. On the other, they might make a useful courtier or a potent spy if I can tolerate their cynical beliefs."
lordaeron.9001.desc.forgotten:0 "Our archivists caught a suspicious individual leaving our library sanctum with copies of classified documents relating to the teachings of Natalie Seline. Apparently the individual is one of these followers of "Forgotten Shadow" who emerged following our excavation of the Undercity. While they are frequently charitable and often noble individuals, their continued proselytization has been known to upset the established order of our land. As this individual stands before me I can see no hint of malice, nor can I ignore the glimmering intellect of a learned priest.\n\nOn one hand, I can deal justice to this individual as I see fit since they are a convicted thief. On the other, they might make a useful courtier or a potent spy if I can tolerate their misguided beliefs."
lordaeron.9001.desc.forsaken:0 "Our apothecaries caught a suspicious individual leaving our experimentation chambers with classified alchemical reagents and recipes. Apparently the individual is one of these "$forsaken_cult_adherent_plural" who still follow the old, autocratic ways. These individuals are known to proselytize actively and often engage in risky and dangerous alchemical practices. As this admittedly talented individual stands before me, I can not ignore the danger they represent to the fledgeling order of the land.\n\nOn one hand, I can deal justice to this individual as I see fit since they are a convicted thief. On the other, while too dangerous to be allowed to remain in the realm, they may prove a potent spy."
lordaeron.9000.opt.e:0 "Execute this insolent fool."
lordaeron.9000.opt.a:0 "Throw the pitiful sod in jail."
lordaeron.9000.opt.b:0 "Fine and release the thief to curry favor with those gone astray."
lordaeron.9000.opt.c:0 "Your talent has granted you a second chance. Come work for me."
lordaeron.9000.opt.e:0 "You live by my will alone, now go and do my bidding..."
