# 1001 - 1099: Reclamation of Lordaeron Events
##############################################

 lordaeron.1001.title:0 "The Undercity Rebuilt"
 lordaeron.1001.desc:0 "The elevator lurches, and for a moment I am startled, but as the descent begins I quickly regain my composure. My engineers assure me these devices work to a high tolerance, but the effect is no less jarring as machines of this size are uncommon in the scourged wasteland that was once Lordaeron.\n\nAs the elevator descends, a dazzling sight begins to open up to me- a vast city beneath a city, bustling with soldiers, traders, magic users, and of course my growing cadre of government officials. The sewer gates have been fortified with iron gates and stone reinforcements. Abominations and Forsaken warriors with their menacing crossbows stand guard. [GetGlobalVariable('sylvanas_character').Char.Custom2('GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveOrMy', ROOT.Char)] dream has been realized... From this underground fortress the Forsaken shall never be dislodged!\n\nAs the descent nears its end, I prepare a few words to the gathered throng of Forsaken and allies. Rumors gathered by my [spymaster] and [court_chaplains] tell of hidden knowledge unearthed in the ruins, which has so far escaped our oversight. Our top agents are tracking down this literature at this moment to gague its usefulness to the realm. For now, I must push these thoughts from my mind as I prepare to inagurate this great edifice of our burgeoning culture.\n\nThe elevator slows to a stop..."
 lordaeron.1001.opt.a:0 "This is a momentous day for the Forsaken!"
 lordaeron.1001.tooltip.a:0 "#X We will find out in time if there is any truth to the rumors of hidden knowledge rediscovered in the sewers...#!"

 lordaeron.1002.title:0 "A Dream Deferred"
 lordaeron.1002.desc:0 "Our efforts to secure the Undercity have come to an end, as we have lost our control over the capital city. Perhaps in a number of years we may be able to try again once we have reconquered this territory which is ours by right, but for now it seems the dream of a home beneath the ruins of Lordaeron is outside our reach."
 lordaeron.1002.opt.a:0 "This loss will not go unavenged!"
 lordaeron.1002.tooltip.a:0 "You or another of your culture will be able to build the Undercity again in 5 years."

#1100 - 1109: Selenite Revival

 lordaeron.1101.title:0 "$forgotten_shadow$: The Selinite Revival"
 lordaeron.1101.desc:0 "And so, the other shoe has dropped. During our construction of the Undercity, rumors abounded of hidden knowledge discovered deep within the sewer system. Our inquisitors, agents, and [court_chaplains] have uncovered cells of hidden crypto-religionists following the so-called $forgotten_shadow$. These teachings originated with Natalie Seline, a priest of Stormwind during the Orcish Invasion who heretically invoked her acolytes to embrace and understand the Shadow as well as the Light. Thusly labeled Selinites, these priests were an effective if unorthodox tool in the ultimately futile fight against the Horde.\n\n Now, with her writings given new context in the wake of the Scorge invasion and occupation of Lordaeron, our people who have embraced this nascent religion have taken to calling themselves $forgotten_shadow_adherent_plural$. Now, my councillors implore me to find a way to proceed regarding this new development..."
 lordaeron.1101.opt.a:0 "We will adapt this forbidden knowledge to our advantage!"
 lordaeron.1101.opt.b:0 "Let us have a separation of church and state. Embrace the shadow!"
 lordaeron.1101.opt.c:0 "Our land can be a home for many faiths. Die and let live..."
