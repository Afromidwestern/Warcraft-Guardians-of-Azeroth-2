 wc_holy_order_decision.0001.desc:0 "The vile orcs have proven that they will stop at nothing to see good men slain. They have massacred the innocent wherever they may be found, including the chapels of the Holy Light.\n\nThe Abbot of Northshire has pleaded with me to allow his clerics and their followers to take up weapons and train for war. To accept could set a dangerous precedent, and may lead to a future war with the Church.\n\nStill, I have no choice. The orcs bear down on us and threaten to eradicate my people. This new fighting force will be known as the Brotherhood of Northshire."
