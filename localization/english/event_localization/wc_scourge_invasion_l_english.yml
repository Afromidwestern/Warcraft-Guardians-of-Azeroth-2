 WCCSC_5_DESC:0 "Darkness has fallen upon Northrend, this day, as a mass of unearthly ice has descended from the heavens to bury itself deep within Icecrown Glacier. Those who beheld it with their own eyes have named it the Frozen Throne, for the great spire looms over all and casts a dread shadow over its new domain.\n\nFrantic tales of creatures losing their minds to madness and of the dead rising as bloodthirsty monsters have quickly spread through your realm, inciting panic and despair. A terrible blight has gripped the roof of the world, and it falls to you to protect your people from this unholy scourge."
