 WCCSC_5_DESC:0 "Darkness has fallen upon Northrend this day, as a mass of unearthly ice has descended from the heavens to bury itself deep within Icecrown Glacier. Those who beheld it with their own eyes have named it the Frozen Throne, for the great spire looms over all and casts a dread shadow over its new domain.\n\nFrantic tales of creatures losing their minds to madness and of the dead rising as bloodthirsty monsters have quickly spread through your realm, inciting panic and despair. A terrible blight has gripped the roof of the world, and it falls to you to protect your people from this unholy scourge."

 WCCSC_30_DESC:0 "At last, freedom! After so many years shackled to the will of your demonic masters, you stand free of all burden after disposing of these pesky dreadlords acting as your jailors. The galls that Kil'jaeden had, to think that such weak sycophants would be good enough watchdogs to ensure your compliance. Humorous images crossed your mind as you imagined his anger once he'd realize what you've accomplished.\n\nNow free to rule over your unending hordes of undead subjects without the Legion nipping at your heels, the world shudders as icy winds coming from Icecrown whisper of your name and commands."
