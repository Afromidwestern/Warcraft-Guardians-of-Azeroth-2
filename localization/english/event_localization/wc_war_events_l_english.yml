 wc_horde_invasion.0001.title:0 "The Conquering of Northshire"
 wc_horde_invasion.0001.desc:0 "Our forces have crushed the wretched humans in the land they call $c_northshire$. The valley was swarming with pilgrims and clerics, all now at our mercy. Their clerics have been nearly wiped out, and we control the valley.\nThe humans are known to keep treasures hidden in their churches, and amidst the chaos, countless souls linger - easy prey for our warriors. My forces demand to pillage and indulge in the bloodshed. However, such an act would surely lead to infighting, and the time could be better spent preparing our future assault.\n\nIf I do not allow them to sate their lust for blood and treasure, my warriors will resent me, but indulging them will waste time and they will only grow more unruly. The choice stands: do we massacre the remnants and take what we can, or conserve our strength for the battles ahead?"
