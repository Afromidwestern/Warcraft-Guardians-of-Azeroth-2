 horde_invasion.0002.title:0 "The Invasion from Draenor"
 horde_invasion.0002.desc:0 "A storm brews over the southern reaches of Azeroth, within the Black Morass. A gateway, the Dark Portal, has been opened to a dying world known as Draenor - home to wild beasts, orcs, ogres and many other vile creatures. Bloodthirsty and in search of new lands, the orcish clans have united beneath a powerful Warchief who rules the Horde with an iron first. Now they seek to go through the Dark Portal and conquer Azeroth!"
 horde_invasion.0002.a:0 "Lok'tar O'gar!"
 horde_invasion.0002.b:0 "Let us wait and see what happens."
 horde_invasion.0002.c:0 "Something must be done about this!"
 horde_invasion.0003.title:0 "Goodbye, Horde!"
 horde_invasion.0003.desc:0 "The Horde has arrived on Azeroth, and is preparing for its offensive under the guidance of Warchief Blackhand. We only have a couple days before it begins, so we must hurry! Where do we go?"
 horde_invasion.0003.a:0 "We have to go north."
 horde_invasion.0003.a_tt:0 "Our home has always been to the north."
 horde_invasion.0003.b:0 "We have to go south."
 horde_invasion.0003.b_tt:0 "Perhaps, the road is going to be challenging, but we can establish our home far from the threat."
 horde_invasion.0003.c:0 "Look for allies."
 horde_invasion.0003.c_tt:0 "Remain a vassal of the Horde for the time being."
 horde_invasion.0005.title:0 "The Long Road to the North"
 horde_invasion.0005.desc:0 "With this new beginning, we have chosen ideals and tradition over unity and bloodshed. It is the first step down a road to an uncertain future, one that may bring glory, prosperity, and security, or maybe death and suffering. Regardless of what lies ahead, you are certain that this is a road that must be travelled, for what lies behind you is a fate that your people cannot bear. Heading north, we have found an inhospitable land of snow and mountains. This will not do. Chieftain, where do we go from here?"
 horde_invasion.0005.a:0 "Let us continue going north."
 horde_invasion.0005.a_tt:0 "You decide to travel further north."
 horde_invasion.0005.b:0 "We should go west."
 horde_invasion.0005.b_tt:0 "You decide to head westwards."
 horde_invasion.0007.title:0 "Alterac Mountains"
 horde_invasion.0007.desc:0 "Far to the north, we have found a mountainous land, with many animals and only a few humans there to trap them. Perhaps this is a good place to make our home."
 horde_invasion.0007.a:0 "This will do."
 horde_invasion.0007.a_tt:0 "You decide to settle in the area."
 horde_invasion.0009.title:0 "Alterac Valley"
 horde_invasion.0009.desc:0 "We've arrived at a sparsely-populated valley. It's far from ideal, since the land seems to be better suited for farming - not something we do as Frostwolves. Still, there are some animals to hunt, and the challenge of hunting sparser game will help strengthen us."
 horde_invasion.0009.a:0 "Dabu!"
 horde_invasion.0011.title:0 "Dun Morogh"
 horde_invasion.0011.desc:0 "Along our travels we found a land with strange, small locals. Some were accommodating, but most were terrified of us! Nevertheless, we learned of a sparsely populated strip of land near the coast. Maybe we can settle there."
 horde_invasion.0011.a:0 "Onwards!"
 horde_invasion.0011.a_tt:0 "You continue going west."
 horde_invasion.0012.title:0 "Western Shore" 
 horde_invasion.0012.desc:0 "After several weeks of wandering, we have finally arrived at what would become our new home, a patch of shoreline in western Khaz Modan. To a new beginning!"
 horde_invasion.0012.a:0 "Dabu!"
 horde_invasion.0014.title:0 "Stranglethorn Vale"
 horde_invasion.0014.desc:0 "My chieftain, this may have been a mistake. With every step, the weather seems to get hotter, the animals larger and nastier, and the plants stranger. It must get better at some point, right?"
 horde_invasion.0014.a:0 "We must press on."
 horde_invasion.0014.a_tt:0 "You continue going south."
 horde_invasion.0016.title:0 "Deep, Harsh South"
 horde_invasion.0016.desc:0 "My chieftain! Our scouts have returned, giving us two choices. Nearby is an area that could be settled, though going further south would give us access to the sea. Which do you choose?"
 horde_invasion.0016.a:0 "We should settle in Surohi."
 horde_invasion.0016.b:0 "It would be wise to settle in Nek'mani."
 horde_invasion.0100.title:0 "Exodus of the Frostwolves"
 horde_invasion.0100.desc:0 "The Frostwolf Clan, ruled the by honourable orc Durotan have found their new home. They have chosen independence from the Horde, and seek to secure the future of their clan by creating a new homeland for their tribe. This has led some clans to label the Frostwolves as traitors, though the Frostwolves counter that those clans in the Horde are traitors to their old ideals and traditions. It remains to be seen just how this new development will impact the other clans. Maybe more will choose tradition over unity?"
 horde_invasion.0100.a:0 "Frost-who?"
 horde_invasion.0100.b:0 "To a new beginning!"
 horde_invasion.0100.c:0 "Best wishes, chieftain."
 horde_invasion.0100.d:0 "Treacherous rats, the Horde will hunt them all down!"
 horde_invasion.0200.title:0 "The Exodus Fails"
 horde_invasion.0200.desc:0 "After an unsuccessful attempt at independence, most the Frostwolf clan has returned to the Horde. However, there are still some remnants that refuse to go back, choosing to wander Azeroth over suffering such an indignity."
 horde_invasion.0200.a:0 "I see."
