 horde_invasion.0002.desc:0 "A storm brews over the southern reaches of Azeroth, within the Black Morass. A gateway, the Dark Portal, has been opened to a dying world known as Draenor - home to wild beasts, orcs, ogres and many other vile creatures. Bloodthirsty and in search of new lands, the orcish clans have united beneath a powerful Warchief who rules the Horde with an iron first. Now they seek to go through the Dark Portal and conquer Azeroth!"

 horde_invasion.0005.desc:0 "With this new beginning, we have chosen ideals and tradition over unity and bloodshed. It is the first step down a road to an uncertain future, one that may bring glory, prosperity, and security, or maybe death and suffering. Regardless of what lies ahead, you are certain that this is a road that must be travelled, for what lies behind you is a fate that your people cannot bear. Heading north, we have found an inhospitable land of snow and mountains. This will not do. Chieftain, where do we go from here?"
 horde_invasion.0005.a:0 "Let us continue going north."
 horde_invasion.0005.a_tt:0 "You decide to travel further north."

 horde_invasion.0200.a:0 "I see."
