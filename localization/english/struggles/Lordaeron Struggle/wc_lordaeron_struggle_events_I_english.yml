 lordaeron_struggle_0501.desc:1 "Lordaeron lies in ruins, ravaged by relentless conflict. As outsiders lay siege to these once-mighty lands, the established powers have been left weakened and fragmented. Now, disparate factions vie for dominion over the remnants of the $game_concept_kingdom$ of Lordaeron, each determined to assert their supremacy and stake a claim on these fractured lands. The fate of this once-proud region hangs in the balance, with uncertainty shrouding its future, and only time will unveil the victor or reveal whether Lordaeron may never fully recover from the devastation that has befallen it."

 lordaeron_struggle_0501.desc:1 "In the shadow of Lordaeron's tragic history, the land now bears the scars of its fall from grace. Once a bastion of human civilization, these hallowed grounds bore witness to the treacherous $game_concept_plague$, the relentless $game_concept_scourge$ invasion, and the harrowing Culling of Stratholme. As the old $game_concept_kingdom$ crumbled, foreign forces seized the opportunity to lay claim to this shattered realm. Now, amidst the ruins and lingering echoes of past horrors, competing factions vie to reignite the flame of Lordaeron's glory or see it forever consumed by the darkness that once plagued it. The fate of these lands remains uncertain."
