 gorian_restoration.0001.desc.ogre:0 " For far too long, our people have been subjugated and oppressed, forced to live under the rule of other nations. But now, thanks to the vision and leadership of our emperor [ROOT.Char.GetName], we have regained our sovereignty and are once again a powerful and prosperous nation. We take great pride in the restoration of our empire and believe that under the emperor's rule, we will thrive and flourish."
 gorian_restoration.0001.desc.moknothal:0 "The restoration of the Gorian Empire is met with mixed emotions. On the one hand, Mok'nothal are proud of our heritage and the role that our ancestors played in the rise of the Gorian Empire. On the other hand, we are acutely aware of the history of oppression and subjugation that our people have faced under the empire's rule. We acknowledge that the restoration of the Gorian Empire brings with it the potential for renewed conflict and suffering. However, we also believe that under the right leadership, the empire can be a force for good in the world, or at least for refugees of Draenor. We see the restoration as an opportunity to reclaim our place in Gorian society and to help shape the future of our nation."

 gorian_restoration.0002.desc.shock:0 "The restoration of the Gorian Empire is a worrying development. The history books are filled with tales of the violence and aggression that characterized the empire's reign on Draenor, and many fear that those same tactics will once again be employed to maintain control. Azeroth has already faced its fair share of conflict and upheaval, from the endless war between the Horde and the Alliance to the squabbles of mighty lords and cheiftans overtaken by their own hunger for power. The last thing the people of Azeroth need is another aggressive and expansionist power threatening the peace."
 gorian_restoration.0002.desc.regular:0 "While it remains to be seen how the newly restored Gorian Empire will behave, many in Azeroth are worried about the potential consequences of its return to power. It is important for leaders to keep a close eye on the situation and take necessary measures to protect their denizens from any potential harm."
