 ### Frostwolf Exodus
 WCFWE_0001_title:0 "The Frostwolf Traitors"
 WCFWE_0001_desc:0 "The Frostwolf clan is nothing but a liability. Not only have they refused to drink the blood of Mannoroth but they are constantly challenging you and your plans. They just cannot be trusted, and that has become clearer every day. Appropriate measures need to be taken... The Frostwolf must leave the Horde immediately, either peacefully or through annihilation."
 WCFWE_0001_a:0 "It is time I deliver them their ultimatum."
 WCFWE_0001_a_tt:0 "You speak to the Frostwolf clan in secret."
 WCFWE_0001_b:0 "They are not a threat at the moment."
 WCFWE_0001_b_tt:0 "You leave them alone for now, the Horde need warriors for the war."

 WCFWE_0002_opening:0 "For [frostwolf_holder.GetTitledFirstName]"
 WCFWE_0002_desc:0 "We must discuss your case, I invite you to meet me in secret on our territory. If you refuse, the repercussions will be incalculable."
 WCFWE_0002_a:0 "We no longer have choice."
 WCFWE_0002_a_tt:0 "You are going to meet [stormreaver_holder.GetFirstName] in secret."

 WCFWE_0003_title:0 "Exiled from the Horde"
 WCFWE_0003_desc:0 "Your persistent and forthright disapproval of the Horde's leadership has finally caught [stormreaver_holder.GetFirstName]'s attention. He has secretly confronted you and told you that your clan was is longer a part of the Horde. In lieu of this, our clan was keenly advised to leave immediately. We were not allowed to return, and all contact had to be broken with the Horde, otherwise he would see every man, woman, and child of the Frostwolves wiped out."
 WCFWE_0003_a:0 "Fine, I cannot endanger my people."
 WCFWE_0003_a_tt:0 "You return to your camp and prepare to leave."
 WCFWE_0003_b:0 "Your threats mean nothing to us, the Horde is our home."
 WCFWE_0003_b_tt:0 "We will not leave the Horde, no matter what."
