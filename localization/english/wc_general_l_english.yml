Thus, defeat only strengthens the swarm. Their enemies, the mogu have created a variety of defensive combat tactics to counter the never-ending mantid.

The vrykul scored immediate victories and built enough momentum to push the highborne out of the city entirely. The highborne's last chance to reclaim the city happened at Nightborne Pass.

Magical fires from the sky hindered the trolls' regeneration, and their morale suffered. After some hours of magical bombardment, the remaining human and elven warriors charged the trolls, broke their lines, and forced them into a terrible rout. Even as they fled, the trolls were pursued and butchered by the merciless allied forces.#!"

Instead of regrouping outside the city to join in the counter-assault, the mages of Mennar stayed behind, erecting magical barriers and turning their once-quiet home into a fortress. Refugees streamed to the Mennar Academy in the first terrible days of the invasion, and survivors rallied to mount a defense. For all their bravery, the mages were unable to withstand the countless legions of demons, yet their heroism breathed hope into the hearts of the peoples of Azeroth.#!"

You see the massive decayed remains of a great kodo.

You feel a surge of admiration and kinship for this noble creature, who shared your values of honor and strength.\n\nYou stand before the kodo's remains for a long time, contemplating its life and death, its lessons and gifts.

#Earth Mother's Blessing Event
tauren_event_2_name:"Spirit Walking"

tauren.2.desc:"You wake up in a beautiful tent, adorned with symbols of nature and tribal beauty. You feel a warm breeze caressing your skin, and the faint scent of herbs and flowers. You look around and realize that this is not at all where you slept last night.\n\nWhere are you? How did you get here? You wonder if this is a dream, or something more. You notice how spacious the tent is, and feel the warth of the cozy fireplace. You see paintings of mountain landscapes and serene mesas, carvings of animals, and woven rugs. You feel a sense of calm and tranquility.\n\nYou notice a cup of warm herbal tea on a wooden table next to your bed. You pick it up and take a sip. As the soothing liquid flow down your throat, you taste the flavors of mint, chamomile, and honey, and feel a wave of relaxation wash over you. The birds chirping sound hits you, inviting you to exit the tent and see the world."
tauren.2.a:"Step outside..."
tauren.21.desc:"As you step outside, you are greeted by the sight of a magnificent city built on towering mesas. Wooden bridges and platforms connect the different levels of this ageless city, and colorful banners and flags wave proudly in the wind. You hear the sound of birds chirping, see hawks swooping and hear kodos rumbling. A surge of joy and awe fills your heart, as you admire this place.\n\nYou see great plains stretching as far as the eye can see. Majestic waterfalls catch your eyes, cascading from cliffs and forming pools and rivers below. Towering mountains stretch in the distance, some covered with snow, others green. The sky above, clear and blue, with a few clouds. You feel like you are in a paradise, a dream come true."
tauren.21.a:"Explore the city further..."
tauren.22.desc:"Feeling a strange pull towards the top of the highest mesa, you decide to head there. You walk along the wooden bridges and platforms, admiring the loving craftsmanship that went into the construction of this magnificent city. White smoke rises from the totemic chimneys of the city's tents, and the aroma of fresh bread and meat makes your stomach rumble. Children dart around you playing and laughing, while elders rest calmly sharing grand tales to the calmer younglings. You see warriors clad in engraved leather armor each styled to represent a different animal practice their skills against one another.\n\nYou look around and see how the inhabitants of this city go about their daily lives. Taurens, orcs and others whom their appearance you've never seen its like before wander about, some trading, others praying and some, even fishing. They all greet you warmly, as if they know you - or better yet, expecting you. You feel a sense of belonging, and before you know it, you find yourself just a few steps away from the mesa's peak. A nearby signpost reads out the mesa's name, High Rise."
tauren.22.a:"Just a little bit further..."
tauren.23.desc:"You reach the top of the highest mesa, where you see a rune circle surrounded by five engraved totems. Each totem is carved in its own intricate form. A spirit animal is perched calmly in front of each totem, occasionally looking around as if its looking out for predators. There is a Wolf, an Elk, a Bear, a Kodo, and a Hawk. Only now do you realize the significance of this place, the spirits of the Earth Mother that you have long sheparded has chosen you as their champion. Very few have ever recieved such a noteworthy blessing, and you feel both humble and proud to be one of the chosen.\n\nYou inspect the five spirit animals, each one radiating a different aura and energy. You feel drawn to each one of them, and they to you, but you can only choose one. You wonder which one will best suit you and your goals. You think about your life, your ambitions, your challenges, and your dreams. You think about what kind of person you are, and what kind of person you want to be.\n\nYou make your decision, and walk towards the spirit animal that calls to you the most. You hope that this will be the right choice for you, and that the Earth Mother will always smile upon you."

tauren.3.desc:"You wake up wet and feeling a freezing cold, barely able to breathe. A sharp pain thumps in your chest, and there's a heavy weight surrounding your limbs. You look around frantically, and see that you are surrounded by trees and shrubbery in all directions. You smell dampness and decay, and hear the sound of animals howling, growling, and screeching. You wonder where you are, and how you got here. You remember that you have angered the spirits of nature, and turned your back on your faith, perhaps they are here to exact their revenge. One way or another.\n\n"You have forsaken the spirits of nature, and they have forsaken you. This is our realm of horror, where the spirits of death dwell. Here you will face your punishment." You hear these words uttered in your mind by a voiceless figure and a shapeless spirit."
tauren.3.a:"Attempt to stand back up..."
tauren.31.desc:"You look at the five spirit animals, each one radiating a different aura and energy. You feel repelled by each one of them, but you know deep down you must decide to suffer the punishment of one of them. You wonder which one will be the least painful or the most merciful for you. You think about your life, your sins, your regrets, and your fears. “If you remember what each of us represented, you’ll know the suffering that each of us will inflict. A final test for this fallen champion…“ The voiceless spirit says.\n\nYou force yourself back to your feet. You ponder for a moment, but eventually make your decision, and walk towards the spirit animal that seems to be the best option for you. You hope that this will be the end of your suffering, or at least a chance for redemption."

tauren_event_4_name:"Spirit Healing"
tauren.4.desc:"You wake up warm and dry in a verdant and yellow forest. You feel a light breeze caressing your skin, and a sweet scent of flowers and fruits. You open your eyes and see that you are lying on a soft bed of grass, and you can breathe easily. You try to move, and you feel that the weight that been holding you down for a while now has dissipated.\n\nYou look around and see that you are surrounded by trees and flowers. You see the sun shining through the branches, and hear the sound of birds singing, and animals playing. You wonder where you are, and how you got here. You remember that you sought repentance, and turned back to the Earth Mother's path."
tauren.4.a:"Attempt to stand back up..."
tauren.41.desc:"You get up and walk around, curious to see more of this place. As you do, you see five familiar faces emerging from the shadows. They are the spirit animals that once blessed you, then cursed you, and now have forgiven you. They look at you with a mix of emotions, some happy, some sad, some proud, some disappointed. They speak to you in a gentle and warm voice.\n\n"You have returned to the Earth Mother's path, and we have allowed it. You have shown remorse and sincerity, and we have appreciated it. You have faced your punishment, and we have lifted it. You are one of our pack, once again."\n\n"You have come to a place of grace and hope, where the spirits of life, and death dwell. Here you can start anew, and rebuild your relationship with the Earth Mother. We are your friends and your mentors, and will guide you whenever you desire. But to be granted our gift once again will require a great deal of perseverance, young one. Forgiveness is a long road, one that you are halfway through...""
