 WCHOI_2_TITLE:0 "The Invasion from Draenor"
 WCHOI_2_DESC:0 "A storm brews over the southern reaches of Azeroth, within the Black Morass. A gateway, the Dark Portal, has been opened to a dying world known as Draenor — home to wild beasts, orcs, ogres and many other vile creatures. Bloodthirsty and in search of new lands, the orcish clans have united beneath a powerful Warchief who rules the Horde with an iron first. Now they seek to go through the Dark Portal and conquer Azeroth!"
 WCHOI_2_OPT_A:0 "Lok'tar ogar!"
 WCHOI_2_OPT_B:0 "Let us wait and see what happens."
 WCHOI_2_OPT_C:0 "Something must be done about this!"
 
 WCHOI_3_DESC:0 "It's time to stop this carnage. The Horde has conquered enough land to start a new life in Azeroth. Many orcs are returning to their families, burying their axes in the ground. They have vowed to forget the horrors of war that they had to go through. The warlords of the Horde still pose a threat to some parts of Azeroth, but the bloodiest wars are behind us since the clans no longer see the point in keeping the united Horde."
 WCHOI_3_OPT_A:0 "The orcs need their warchief!"
 WCHOI_3_OPT_B:0 "We will go our own way."
 ITS_OVER:0 "It's over..."
 
 horde_invite_bloodthirsty_clans:0 "Invite Remaining Clans"
 horde_invite_bloodthirsty_clans_desc:0 "A lot of orcs are left beyond the Dark Portal. We need all the clans, if we want to gain a foothold in Azeroth."
 horde_invite_bloodthirsty_clans_tooltip:0 "Gets [special_troops|E] and create a few new [vassals|E]"
 horde_invite_bloodthirsty_clans_confirm:0 "Summon them"
 
 LOKTAR_OGAR:0 "Lok'tar ogar!"
 EVTDESC_WCFTW_4:0 "Draenor continues to slowly die. Now, none of the orcs have a desire to remain on a perishing world. Those who were left on Draenor are now hungry, sick and insane... but have crossed the line between the worlds. Among them are the most bloodthirsty bands of orcs, who inspire fear and respect in other, less virulent clans. The clans of the Burning Blade and the Dragonmaw will overwhelm anyone who stands in the way of the Horde."

 ### Frostwolf Exodus
 WCHOI_1000_title:0 "The Frostwolf Traitors"
 WCHOI_1000_desc:0 "The Frostwolf clan is nothing but a liability. Not only have they refused to drink the blood of Mannoroth but they are constantly challenging you and your plans. They just cannot be trusted, and that has become clearer every day. Appropriate measures need to be taken... The Frostwolf must leave the Horde immediately, either peacefully or through annihilation."
 WCHOI_1000_a:0 "It is time I deliver them their ultimatum."
 WCHOI_1000_a_tt:0 "You speak to the Frostwolf clan in secret."
 WCHOI_1000_b:0 "They are not a threat at the moment."
 WCHOI_1000_b_tt:0 "You leave them alone for now, the Horde need warriors for the war."

 WCHOI.1001_opening:0 "For [frostwolf_holder.GetTitledFirstName]"
 WCHOI.1001_desc:0 "We must discuss your case, I invite you to meet me in secret on our territory. If you refuse, the repercussions will be incalculable."
 WCHOI.1001_a:0 "We no longer have choice."
 WCHOI.1001_a_tt:0 "You are going to meet [stormreaver_holder.GetFirstName] in secret."

 WCHOI_1002_title:0 "Exiled from the Horde"
 WCHOI_1002_desc:0 "Your persistent and forthright disapproval of the Horde's leadership has finally caught [stormreaver_holder.GetFirstName]'s attention. He has secretly confronted you and told you that your clan was is longer a part of the Horde. In lieu of this, our clan was keenly advised to leave immediately. We were not allowed to return, and all contact had to be broken with the Horde, otherwise he would see every man, woman, and child of the Frostwolves wiped out."
 WCHOI_1002_a:0 "Fine, I cannot endanger my people."
 WCHOI_1002_a_tt:0 "You return to your camp and prepare to leave."
 WCHOI_1002_b:0 "Your threats mean nothing to us, the Horde is our home."
 WCHOI_1002_b_tt:0 "We will not leave the Horde, no matter what.
