 wc_lordaeron_opening.1.desc:0 "Many things can be said about King Terenas II, but one thing is certain - he is and always was the beloved monarch of Lordaeron. Thanks to the deeds of his precedessors who led Lordaeron into greatness, Terenas II found himself ruling over vast portion of human lands for thirty years now, and thanks to his impressive diplomatic approach towards his neighbors and personal friendship with King Thoras of Stromgarde, he has ensured a lasting peace between human kingdoms on the continent, something that was unheard of several generations ago. However, there might be a major danger to the status quo, as rumors abound about an unknown threat far to the south, encroaching upon the lands of Stormwind and its human populace. It remains to be seen what role will Lordaeron play in light of these events, and whether the human unity will persist against the coming tide."

 wc_lordaeron_opening.2.desc:0 "Years pass, and yet King Terenas II still endures. Having ruled the kingdom of Lordaeron for fifty years, he was responsible for some of the greatest achievements for the human race. Thanks to his ever-skillful diplomacy, he has not only managed to bring lasting peace to the continent and establish cordial relations between human kingdoms, but also gained the support of elves and dwarves, finally ushering in an Alliance - a pact against a common enemy, the Orcish Horde. However, the Alliance was not without its own share of problems afterwards. Years have passed since the greenskins have suffered total defeat in their war against the united races of the Eastern Kingdoms, and now internal problems started resurfacing in the entire Alliance. The first to leave the Alliance were the High Elves, who blamed the humans for not being able to save their burned forests, and later the humans have once again started bickering amongst themselves - the next to leave were Gilneans, as they had enough of someone else's problems, sealing themselves behind the Greymane Wall. Another major problem was the Orcish Question, leading to the schism between Terenas and Thoras, who proposed to exterminate the Orcs entirely, a proposal that was refused by Terenas, leading to the withdrawal of Stromgarde from the Alliance. With the Alliance weakened, Terenas had shifted focus on his own homeland in order to properly rebuild. It appeared that the peace has mostly returned to Lordaeron. However, in the recent days a mysterious figure had appeared, warning about the 'great flame' and urged the humans to flee westwards, who was immediately dismissed as a madman, while the royal council bickers about rumors of a plague in the east. With all these issues arising, King Terenas must prepare himself to lead Lordaeron through another crisis."
