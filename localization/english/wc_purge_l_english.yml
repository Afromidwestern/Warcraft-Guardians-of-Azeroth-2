 purge.0010.desc:0 "We woke up early as always, didn't have much problem packing up everything and moving the camp to the next location. We barely saw a few deers on the way to OUR OBJECTIVE. It's almost too calm, like if something bad is going to happen..."
 purge.0010.a:0 "OUR OBJECTIVE is near, we must continue our quest."

 purge.0011.t:0 "Biproduct of the Plague"
 purge.0011.desc:0 "While marching something appeared out of nowhere. It was partially decomposing, smelled like death and was barely concious, seems like the reports weren't wrong. Seems like the Plague also affects animals and turn them into crazy bloodthirsty creatures, so far it seems this one... oh no, it's coming!"

 purge.0011.a:0 "I will kill this beast with my very own hands!"
 purge.0011.a.success:0 "Yes! It is done, killed by my very own hands."
 purge.0011.a.failure:0 "No! The creature was just too strong, but at least I'm alive."
 purge.0011.a.critical_failure:0 "This... monster destroyed me, I don't know if I can continue, I don't feel well at all..."

 purge.0011.b:0 "Wait! There's still some life inside this creature, I think I can calm it down."
 purge.0011.b.critical_success:0 "A shadow of a shadow, now it even glows... it dies peacefully"
 purge.0011.b.success:0 "Seems like the beast has calmed down, now it's following the path and... it's gone."
 purge.0011.b.failure:0 "No! There's no way I could calm it down what was I thinking? Now I'm injured."
 purge.0011.b.critical_failure:0 "Agh! My hand! While trying to calm it down it... it bite it off, it's gone now..."

 purge.0011.c:0 "No way I'm facing this creature, we must flee somehow."
 purge.0011.c.success:0 "Ha ha! We were too fast for the creature, now I barely can see it."
 purge.0011.c.failure:0 "Dammit... that thing managed to maul some of our carriage."
 purge.0011.c.critical_failure:0 "No no no! It killed many of my men... why would I run? Now they hate me..."
