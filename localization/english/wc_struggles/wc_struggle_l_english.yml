 game_concept_struggle_lordaeron_phase_opportunity_desc:2 "After a long period of relatively peaceful coexistence during the [struggle_lordaeron_phase_conciliation|E], complacency begins to set in. Peasantry and nobility alike are comfortable that things just #EMP work#!, allowing more shrewd [characters|E] to take advantage of their naivety.\n\nEventually, fresh abuses will either cause an escalation into the [struggle_lordaeron_phase_hostility|E], or else savvy politicking reaches an uneasy equilibrium through the [struggle_lordaeron_phase_conciliation|E]."

 game_concept_struggle_lordaeron_phase_hostility_desc:2 "Tensions flare and tempers fray in this $game_concept_struggle_phase_phase$. Repeated acts of malice and escalated misunderstandings during  the [struggle_lordaeron_phase_opportunity|E] have lead to rising hatred of [characters|E] with differing [cultures|E], [faiths|E], or #EMP worse#!: both.\n\nSuch bloodshed cannot persist forever, though. Eventually, either cooler heads or simple exhaustion bring the region to the [struggle_lordaeron_phase_compromise|E]."

Differences fall by the wayside and shared history and heritage binds former foes together.\n\nThe region stands at a cross-roads: if conflicts reappear, then the [struggle_lordaeron_phase_opportunity|E] awaits."

 game_concept_struggle_lordaeron_phase_conciliation_desc:1 "The product of a notable [struggle_lordaeron_phase_compromise|E], during this $game_concept_struggle_phase_phase$, relations between the peoples of Lordaeron grow so cordial that outsiders find their permissiveness difficult to parse. Inter-[faith|E] [marriages|E] are particularly common.\n\nThis can't last forever, though, and abuses of trust will eventually bring the [lordaeron_struggle|E] back around to the [struggle_lordaeron_phase_compromise|E]."
