 bm_the_reign_of_chaos:0 "Die Herrschaft des Chaos"
 bm_the_reign_of_chaos_desc:0 "Jahre nach dem Ende des Zweiten Krieges haben sich die Östlichen Königreiche noch immer nicht von den Verwüstungen erholt, die Land und Leuten zugefügt wurden. Die Allianz ist durch diverse Krisen geschwächt, nachdem einige Königreiche sich von Lordaeron distanziert haben, um ihr eigenes, unabhängiges Schicksal zu verfolgen. Während noch immer Kämpfe zwischen Resten der Horde und Rebellen schwelen, greift im Osten Lordaerons eine mysteriöse Seuche um sich. Gerüchte kursieren über die Untergangswarnung eines verrückten Propheten und über die Notwendigkeit, nach Westen zu fliehen. Prinz Arthas Menethil jedoch bleibt standhaft und will sein Volk und sein zukünftiges Reich beschützen.\nAuf dem arktischen Kontinent Northrend ist unterdessen der Kontakt zu allen menschlichen Siedlungen abgebrochen und die einst so mächtigen Reiche der Nerubier und Drakkari-Trolle ziehen sich vor der neu erstarkenden Macht des Lichkönigs zurück. Dieses mysteriöse Wesen erweckt die Toten und bereitet sich auf einen Krieg gegen die Lebenden vor. Nur wenige können sich ihm im Norden entgegenstellen, und er könnte auch Pläne für den Rest der Welt haben...\n\nWerden die Königreiche der Allianz zusammenhalten, um sich dieser neuen Krise zu stellen, oder werden sie auf sich gestellt untergehen? Wird der Lichkönig siegen wo die Horde versagt hat und Azeroth ins Verderben stürzen? Wer wird als Sieger hervorgehen aus der Herrschaft des Chaos?"

 darkhan_character_desc:0 "A magister, mage-lord of Quel'Thalas, Dar'Khan served his liege, king Anasterian, as well as the Alliance against the trolls and orcs during the second war, and he did so with great skill and efficiency. The mage, however, is also an expert on the magic of the Sunwell, Quel'Thalas's main source of power, as well as in the arts of magical buildings and esoteric studies. Despite all his accomplishments, Dar'Khan lacks the recognition he deserves and aspires to more than what his ungrateful peers accept to grant him, yet he knows he is capable to achieve greatness and leave his mark on history. Is Dar'Khan promised a great destiny, or will he be forgotten like so many before him, that weren't ambitious enough?"

Wise but proud, the old king values independence and tranquility and as such withdrew entirely from the Alliance after victory was acquired against the Horde during the Second War. With threats repelled from the frontiers, Anasterian is confident that his kingdom's magical superiority will assure his people's safety and prosperity. However, numerous elves including crown-prince Kael'Thas remain sympathetic to the Alliance and believe it is the elves' duty to help their former allies in these difficult, changing times. Even the secluded elves can't ignore the events of the world forever. What destiny awaits the elven king and his people? To prosper secluded in their magical kingdom? To unite with their former allies against a darker threat? To fall into oblivion alone? Or perhaps to take an even greater place in the world?"

 #Ner'zhul

 nerzhul_character_desc:0 "Once, Ner'zhul was an orc. As chieftain of the Shadowmoon clan and elder shaman, he was the spiritual leader of the orcs, deceived to unite them into the Horde by the demon Kil'Jaeden as a tool of war for the Burning Legion. When he opposed his demonic master, Ner'zhul was betrayed and replaced by his apprentice, Gul'dan. When the Horde was finally defeated and Draenor destroyed, Ner'zhul fled, only to be captured by the Legion. For his treason, he was remade into the Lich King, a new weapon of war against Azeroth. Sent to the continent of Northrend to prepare for his mission, the Lich King discovered and unleashed his immense powers under the vigilant supervision of the Legion. Ner'zhul has built the base of a new order, but to the Legion, he will be the vanguard of their invasion. Will Ner'zhul ensure the Legion's return? Will he be stopped before such tragedy could occur... Or will he become his own master, ruler of both the dead and the world?"

Under his leadership, the merchant kingdom became the strongest naval power in the world and pledged its fleet to the Alliance's service. As Grand Admiral of the Alliance, Daelin Proudmoore brought victory against the Horde during the Second War, during which his son and heir Derek died to orcish hands, and remained one of the Alliance's strongest supporters after its end. Even if the sea protects his kingdom from threats, being epidemic or orc aggression, the admiral remains vigilant and knows that his fleet will be vital to the Alliance in case of a new war, he also knows that whoever holds the sea... holds the world. What destiny awaits Daelin and Kul Tiras? Being the Alliance's new base of power? To lead humanity oversea in search of new lands to colonize? To be washed away by the tides?"
