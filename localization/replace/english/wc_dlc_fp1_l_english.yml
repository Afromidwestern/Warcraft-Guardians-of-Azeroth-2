 fp1_yearly.0051.desc:1 "[draugr.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] death some time ago did not go unmarked by the common people of [capital_county.GetNameNoTier]. Whatever else [draugr.GetSheHe] may have been, [draugr.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was not popular with the local peasantry, and it has become the norm for every ill in the land to be blamed on the [draugr.Custom('WomanManPossessive')] walking corpse.\n\nNot a week seems to go by any more without every farmer, forester, and dung-shoveller within spitting distance of the capital complaining about [draugr.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] vargul.\n\n#EMP Something#! must be done."

There must be a dozen or more, each as large as a man, and already at a dead-run from every direction.\n\nThe peasants were wrong about the vargul, but not about the curse!"
